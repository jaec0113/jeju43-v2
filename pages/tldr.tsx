      <h1>Jeju 4.3 Incident tl;dr</h1>
      <p>
        It is not recommended to try and understand the Jeju 4.3 Incident
        through a summarized form due to the large amount of complexities that
        are related to why it happened, what happened, and the aftermath.
        However, if you are trying to get a {`'`}birds eye view{`'`} of the it
        before learning more, then you can start here.

        <h3>What caused Jeju 4.3?</h3>
        <p>
          The Jeju 4.3 Incident was caused by a series of local issues - torture
          and harassment by the police (with no repercussions), a struggling
          economy, the re-emergence of pro-Japan policemen and officials - and
          the split of the country into North and South Korea nationally.

        <h3>What was the Jeju 4.3?</h3>
        <p>
          On April 3, 1948 armed members of the South Korea Labor Party Jeju
          branch attacked police stations and right wing militant groups in
          protest of local issues and national issues (see above). After a few
          months, the police and army began to ramp up their suppression methods
          leading to the deaths of hundreds of civilians. In the fall/winter of
          1948 and into early 1949, tens of thousands of Jeju civilians were
          killed in the name of suppressing and ending the (allegedly) communist
          armed resistance.

        <h3>What happened after 4.3 ended?</h3>
        <p>
          The fighting in Jeju largely ended in June 1949 after the death of the
          second commander of the armed resistance, Lee Deokgu, was killed.
          Officially it ended in 1954 when the ban on the entry to Halla
          Mountain was lifted. During that time period many hundreds - thousands
          of Jeju civilians were killed during the Korean War - again in the
          name of fighting communism. After that the government tried to sweep
          the Jeju 4.3 Incident {`'`}under the rug{`'`}. They were largely
          successful as a generation of Koreans grew up not knowing that such an
          event happened. The discovery of Darangshi Cave in 1991/1992 was one
          of the first major events that led to people learning about Jeju 4.3.
          In 1998, President Kim Daejung called for a special investigation into
          4.3 and the National Assemby passed a law a year later in 1999 that
          would allow the government to begin investigating. That process began
          in 2003, and the same year President Roh Moohyeon became the first
          sitting president to apologize for the incident. President Moon Jaein
          did the same when he became president, and in 2019 the Defense
          Ministry and police also officially apologized for the incident as
          well.
