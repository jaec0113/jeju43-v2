        <h3>How is the Jeju 4.3 Incident viewed today?</h3>
        <p>
          Compared to even 5-10 years ago, people are much more aware of the
          Jeju 4.3 Incident. However, much is still fuzzy for most of the
          general population in Korea as there are a lot of conflicting and
          politically tinted views out there. Broadly speaking I would say that
          most are aware that it happened and that many people were killed by
          the South Korean government. Why it happened and whether the police
          and military{`'`}s actions were justified is where there is a lot more
          confusion and conflict.

        <h3>What about the accusations of communism?</h3>
        <p>
          My personal standpoint is somewhere in between the views out there.
          You still have plenty of people (usually conservative politically) who
          will claim that the resistance group was part of a broader communist
          plot to disrupt and overthrow the newly established South Korean
          government and to help united the country under Kim Ilsung{`'`}s
          communist North Korea. You will also find people (often older Jeju
          residents) who will claim that there were zero communists in Jeju at
          the time and certainly not in the resistance group.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that research clearly shows that there were people within
          the resistance that supported the ideas of communism and favored a
          unified Korea under Kim Ilsung. However, I think the research also
          shows that there were significant grievances the Jeju people had that
          were completely unrelated to communism that were larger drivers of the
          decision to begin an armed resistance. There is no real evidence to
          support the idea that North Korea supported the resistance other then
          in idea nor is there any real supporting evidence to suggest that the
          national South Korea Labor Party (which was communist in nature)
          supported the resistance either - again except in idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if one reads through the events on this site and elsewhere and
          still feels uncomfortable with the potential communist elements with
          the armed resistance{`'`}s leadership, I believe it is still important
          to look at the police and military{`'`}s actions with regards to the
          resistance and the broader Jeju population. The armed resistance at
          its peak likely never numbered more than several hundred members
          (maybe 400 or so). Additionally the best equipment they had were old
          bolt action rifles the Japanese left after World War II. Many were
          equipped with simple spears that were made out of bamboo. To kill
          20-30,000 in order to catch 400 or so is virtually unjustifiable.

        <h3>What about the US and their responsibility?</h3>
        <p>
          This is a topic that has seemingly grown in voice over the recent
          years (usually among those more on the left of the political
          spectrum). Does the US bear ultimate responsibility for the deaths of
          the Jeju people? Should the US also apologize for the Jeju 4.3
          Incident? Should the US pay reparations to the Jeju people who those
          who died?
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea stems from the fact that USAMGIK (United States Army Military
          Government in Korea) was the ultimate power in charge in Jeju (and
          South Korea) when the 4.3 Incident started. Additionally some of the
          repressive methods implemented were done so, broadly speaking, under
          USAMGIK rule (most of those continued or were expanded under the newly
          formed South Korean Rhee Syngman government).
        </p>
        <p>
          The counterargument that one often hears is that while USAMGIK may
          have been in charge, all of those orders came from the South Korean
          police and military. Additionally there is no direct evidence that
          USAMGIK ordered any of the suppression methods. However, many will
          counterargue that it is not possible for USAMGIK to be unaware of what
          the police and army were doing, and if USAMGIK had wished to stop it
          they could have easily. Therefore proving direct US involvement is
          unnecessary as they are already tacitly guilty of what happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think, if anyone is waiting for an official US apology and
          recognition of their actions, I feel I can confidently say that day
          will likely never come as the US does not easily recognize the country
          {`'`}s misdeeds overseas - particularly one where there is no evidence
          that directly implicates them. Whether they should, is of course, a
          different issue. At a company, does the CEO bare responsibility for
          the misdeeds of middle management? When the misdeed is as big as the
          Jeju 4.3 Incident and when there is enough circumstantial evidence as
          there is, I believe the answer is probably {`"`}yes{`"`}. Given the
          level of action taken and the fact that none of it was done secretly
          or even slightly discretely, there is virtually no chance that USAMGIK
          did not know what the police or army were doing.
