            <h3>How is the Jeju 4.3 Incident viewed today?</h3>
            <p>
              Compared to even 5-10 years ago, people are much more aware of the
              Jeju 4.3 Incident. However, much about the Jeju 4.3 Incident is
              still a bit fuzzy for most of the general population in Korea as
              there are a lot of conflicting and politically tinted views out
              there. Broadly speaking I would say that most are broadly aware
              that it happened and that many people were killed by the South
              Korean government. Why it happened and whether the police and
              military{`'`}s actions were justified is where there is a lot more
              confusion and conflict.

            <h3>What about the accusations of communism?</h3>
            <p>
              My personal standpoint is somewhere in between the views out
              there. You still have plenty of people (usually conservative
              politically) who will claim that the resistance group was part of
              a broader communist plot to disrupt and overthrow the newly
              established South Korean government and to help united the country
              under Kim Ilsung
              {`'`}s communist North Korea. You will also find people (often
              older Jeju residents) who will claim that there were zero
              communists in Jeju at the time and certainly not in the resistance
              group. For what it is worth, the documents and reports produced
              officially by the government seem to take the line that there
              while there were communist tinges in the group (IE Kim Dalsam),
              there is little evidence to suppor the idea that the movement was
              a communist plot to unify the country under a communist regime and
              that the majority of the victims had little or no interest in
              communism.
            </p>
            <p>
              I tend to agree with that interpretation and believe that while
              the research clearly shows that there were people within the
              resistance that supported the ideas of communism and favored a
              unified Korea under communist rule. However, I think the research
              also shows that there were significant grievances the Jeju people
              had that were completely unrelated to communism that were larger
              drivers of the decision to begin an armed resistance. There is no
              real evidence to support the idea that North Korea supported the
              resistance other then in idea nor is there any real supporting
              evidence to suggest that the national South Korea Labor Party
              (which was communist in nature) supported the resistance either -
              again except in idea.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even if one reads through the events on this site and elsewhere
              and still feels uncomfortable with the potential communist
              elements with the armed resistance{`'`}s leadership, I believe it
              is still important to look at the police and military{`'`}s
              actions with regards to the resistance and the broader Jeju
              population. The armed resistance at its peak likely never numbered
              more than several hundred members (maybe 400 or so). Additionally
              the best equipment they had were old bolt action rifles the
              Japanese left after World War II. Many were equipped with simple
              spears that were made out of bamboo. To kill 20-30,000 in order to
              catch 400 or so is virtually unjustifiable.

            <h3>What about the US and their responsibility?</h3>
            <p>
              This is a topic that has seemingly grown in voice over the recent
              years (usually among those more on the left of the political
              spectrum). Does the US bear ultimate responsibility for the deaths
              of the Jeju people? Should the US also apologize for the Jeju 4.3
              Incident? Should the US pay reparations to the Jeju people who
              those who died?
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea stems from the fact that USAMGIK (United States Army
              Military Government in Korea) was the ultimate power in charge in
              Jeju (and South Korea) when the 4.3 Incident started. Additionally
              some of the repressive methods implemented were done so, broadly
              speaking, under USAMGIK rule (most of those continued or were
              expanded under the newly formed South Korean Rhee Syngman
              government).
            </p>
            <p>
              The counterargument that one often hears is that while USAMGIK may
              have been in charge, all of those orders came from the South
              Korean police and military. Additionally there is no direct
              evidence that USAMGIK ordered any of the suppression methods.
              However, many will counterargue that it is not possible for
              USAMGIK to be unaware of what the police and army were doing, and
              if USAMGIK had wished to stop it they could have easily. Therefore
              proving direct US involvement is unnecessary as they are already
              tacitly guilty of what happened.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think, if anyone is waiting for an official US apology and
              recognition of their actions, I feel I can confidently say that
              day will likely never come as the US does not easily recognize the
              country
              {`'`}s misdeeds overseas - particularly one where there is no
              evidence that directly implicates them. Whether they should, is of
              course, a different issue. At a company, does the CEO bare
              responsibility for the misdeeds of middle management? When the
              misdeed is as big as the Jeju 4.3 Incident and when there is
              enough circumstantial evidence as there is, I believe the answer
              is probably {`"`}yes{`"`}. Given the level of action taken and the
              fact that none of it was done secretly or even slightly
              discretely, there is virtually no chance that USAMGIK did not know
              what the police or army were doing.

            <h3>
              Why should I know about 4.3? What should I take from learning
              about it?
            </h3>
            <p>
              When talking about 4.3 - especially to younger students - this is
              always a difficult question to answer. Why teach young Koreans
              about the horrors that their own government inflicted upon their
              ancestors?Knowing how their grandparents or fellow countrymen were
              tortured and killed for little or no reason, what should they do
              with that information?
            </p>
            <p>Again, personally I take three levels to this idea.</p>
            <p>
              The first is simply to know what happened. To know what the police
              did. To know how the people suffered. To know when and where it
              happened. If no one knows what happened, then did it happen? That
              seemed to be the stance and hope of the South Korean government
              for so long. Never speak of it and it will be forgotten as if it
              never happened. As such, the minimum is know about the history so
              it does not disappear.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second is to understand why it happened. To understand the
              circumstances that allowed such a tragic and terrible happening to
              occur. To understand how politicians or people in leadership
              positions may manipulate information or emotions to get the result
              they want. To understand the potential warning signs when people
              start to {`'`}other
              {`'`} people. To understand the importance of media and a free and
              honest press.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third level is to understand how 4.3 affected the Jeju people
              going forward, how it still impacts people today, how to take what
              one learned in the second level and apply it to politics today. To
              see how people fought to clear their names of false charges. To
              see how politicians today may use similar tactics to achieve
              similar effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              How much should people learn? How much should one teach about 4.3?
              I think that{`'`}s probably a case-by-case type thing to a certain
              extent. I don{`'`}t think people who talk about or teach about 4.3
              should ever be {`'`}afraid{`'`} of talking about anything that may
              fall in those different levels, but I don{`'`}t think everyone
              needs to know everything. Younger children may not need to know
              (yet) things pertaining to my level 2 and 3. Not all adults need
              to know all of it either. Some people may not be ready to hear
              everything. Some people may not want to hear everything. Learning
              about and teaching about 4.3 is something that I think is a long
              (for lack of a better word) battle.{" "}
